        <h3>The best pieces in my option is the T piece and the I piece. These pieces will be able to help you downstack
            and counterspike the opponent. When making a T spin the amount of lines cleared doubled is the amount you
            will send to your opponent, with the exception of a tsipin single. While the I piece can help you clear four
            lines at once when having a good well. Using these two pieces togther you able to create a massive spike.

            I-piece is the longest piece meaning that you are able to clear four lines at once.
